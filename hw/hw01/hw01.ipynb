    "Before we write any code, let’s review the idea of hypothesis testing with the permutation test. We first simulate the experiment many times (say, 10,000 times) through random permutation (i.e., without replacement). Assuming that the null hypothesis holds, this process will produce an empirical distribution of a predetermined test statistic. Then, we use this empirical distribution to compute an empirical p-value, which is then compared against a particular cutoff threshold in order to accept or reject our null hypothesis. \n",

    "* What does an empirical p-value from a permutation test mean in this particular context of birthweights and maternal smoking habits?\n",
    "* Suppose the resulting empirical p-value $p \\leq 0.01$, where $0.01$ is our p-value cutoff threshold. Do we accept or reject the null hypothesis? Why?\n"
