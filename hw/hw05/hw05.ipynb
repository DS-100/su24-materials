    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the process of signing up, renting, and returning is automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one location and return them to another. We will be analyzing bike-sharing data from Washington, DC. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will perform tasks to clean, visualize, and explore the bike-sharing data. You will also investigate open-ended questions. These open-ended questions ask you to think critically about how the plots you have created provide insight into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading plain text delimited data into `pandas`,\n",
    "* Wrangling data for analysis,\n",
    "* Using EDA to learn about your data, and \n",
    "* Making informative plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into auto-graded answers and free responses. For auto-graded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests. For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question. Most of the plots will be manually graded. Your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will accept small variations, such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However, it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible, as similarity is subject to the readers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that for ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect descriptive titles, axis labels, legends, etc. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question?** \n",

    "## Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question in the assignment, please write down your answer in the answer cell(s) right below the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run code, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note: The local autograder tests will not be comprehensive. You can pass the automated tests in your notebook but still fail tests in the autograder.** Please be sure to check your results carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unless we state otherwise, **do not use for loops or list comprehensions**. The majority of this assignment can be done using built-in commands in `pandas` and `NumPy`.  Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Guide\n",
    "If you run into any technical issues, we highly recommend checking out the [Data 100 Debugging Guide](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/). In this guide, you can find general questions about Jupyter notebooks / Datahub, Gradescope, and common `pandas` errors."
