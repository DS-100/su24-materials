    "#### An Important Note on One-Hot-Encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, simply replacing the integers with the appropriate strings isn’t sufficient for using `Roof Material` in our model.  Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data. For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function `ohe_roof_material` that returns a `DataFrame` with the new column one-hot-encoded on the roof material of the household. These new columns should have the form `Roof Material_MATERIAL`. Your function should return a new `DataFrame` and **should not modify the existing `DataFrame`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** You should use sklearn's `OneHotEncoder` class ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)) when doing your one-hot encoding. `OneHotEncoder` will automatically generate column names of the form `Roof Material_MATERIAL`. Note that `OneHotEncoder` transforms data into a [SciPy sparse matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html) to save space; we'll need to convert these back into regular arrays before doing any operations on them. Check out `.toarray()` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.toarray.html)) for how to convert this to a `NumPy` array.\n",
