    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",

    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",

    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",
