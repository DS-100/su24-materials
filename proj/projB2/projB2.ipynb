To get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **85%** accuracy on both the train and test set (see Question 3 for the partial credit breakdown).

    "    1. Number/percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. Alternatively, you can identify misclassified emails and see which relevant words are missing in your model.\n",
    "1. Reducing dimensionality and/or multicollinearity.\n",
    "    1. One way to do this is to interpret the model coefficients. Note that a feature will be more valuable in classification if its coefficient has a larger **absolute** value. If the coefficient has a lower **absolute** value, the feature likely isn't valuable in classifying emails.\n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust the parameters of your model (e.g. the penalty type, the regularization parameter, or any arguments in `LogisticRegression`) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation for feature and model selection! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "    1. Consider implementing L1 regularization. The [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for `LogisticRegression` may be helpful here. \n",
    "    1. We have imported `GridSearchCV` for you. You may use sklearn's `GridSearchCV` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)) class to perform cross-validation. You do not need to code cross-validation from scratch, though you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `GridSearchCV`. Suppose we wanted to experiment with 4 different solvers (numerical methods for optimizing the mode) models for a `LogisticRegression` model `lr_model`. \n",
    "1. We could define a dictionary specifying the hyperparameters and the specific values we want to try out like so: `parameters = {'solver':[{'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'saga']}`.\n",
    "2. Running `grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr_model, param_grid=parameters)` would give us a model for each combination of hyperparameters we are testing - in this case, just 4 models.\n",
    "3. We fit each model to some training data `X_train` and `Y_train` using `grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, Y_train)`.\n",
    "4. Indexing into `grid_result.cv_results_` with a particular metric (in this case, `mean_test_score`), we get an array with the scores corresponding to each of the models. `grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']`.\n",
